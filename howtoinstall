Package details
Installs binary to /usr/sbin/grafana-server
Copies init.d script to /etc/init.d/grafana-server
Installs default file (environment vars) to /etc/sysconfig/grafana-server
Copies configuration file to /etc/grafana/grafana.ini
Installs systemd service (if systemd is available) name grafana-server.service
The default configuration uses a log file at /var/log/grafana/grafana.log
The default configuration specifies an sqlite3 database at /var/lib/grafana/grafana.db
Start the server (init.d service)
You can start Grafana by running:

# service grafana-server start

This will start the grafana-server process as the grafana user, which is created during package installation. The default HTTP port is 3000, and default user and group is admin.
http//ip address:3000

Default login and password admin/ admin

To configure the Grafana server to start at boot time:


# /sbin/chkconfig --add grafana-server

Start the server (via systemd)

# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl start grafana-server
# systemctl status grafana-server

Enable the systemd service to start at boot


# systemctl enable grafana-server.service

Environment file
The systemd service file and init.d script both use the file located at /etc/sysconfig/grafana-server for environment variables used when starting the back-end. Here you can override log directory, data directory and other variables.

Logging
By default Grafana will log to /var/log/grafana

Database
The default configuration specifies a sqlite3 database located at /var/lib/grafana/grafana.db. Please backup this database before upgrades. You can also use MySQL or Postgres as the Grafana database, as detailed on the configuration page.

Configuration
The configuration file is located at /etc/grafana/grafana.ini. Go the Configuration page for details on all those options.

Adding data sources
Graphite
InfluxDB
OpenTSDB
Prometheus
Server side image rendering
Server side image (png) rendering is a feature that is optional but very useful when sharing visualizations, for example in alert notifications.
If the image is missing text make sure you have font packages installed.


# yum install fontconfigy
# yum install freetype* -y
# yum install urw-fonts

Installing from binary tar file
Download the latest .tar.gz file and extract it. This will extract into a folder named after the version you downloaded. This folder contains all files required to run Grafana. There are no init scripts or install scripts in this package.

To configure Grafana add a configuration file named custom.ini to the conf folder and override any of the settings defined in conf/defaults.ini.

Start Grafana by executing ./bin/grafana-server web. The grafana-server binary needs the working directory to be the root install directory (where the binary and the public folder is located).

Logging in for the first time
To run Grafana open your browser and 
go to 

Final test

http://your ip address:3000/
